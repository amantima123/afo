# Ant Foraging Optimization through Artificial Pheromone System
In this project, the foraging pattern found in ants and other 'swarm intel
ligent' insects is simulated using random walk model. The first iteratio
n uses the ants' odor memory to influence each ants' choice of moving in
either of the four directions. As expected, the steps taken by the colon
y gets reduced significantly and a pheromone trail is updated based on t
he grid locations each ant has to traverse and its last location. Latter
iterations show that simulations aided by both odor memory and pheromone
trails optimize the steps the colony has to take to reach to the food.
